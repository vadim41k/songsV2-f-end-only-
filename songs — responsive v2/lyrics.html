        Hey Jude, don't be afraid<br>

        The minute you let her under your skin<br>
        Then you begin to make it better<br>
        <br>
        And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain<br>
        Don't carry the world upon your shoulders<br>
        For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br>
        By making his world a little colder<br>

      <h2 id="lyric7">Chuck Berry, 'Johnny B. Goode'</h2>
      <div>
        Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans,<br>
        Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
        There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,<br>
        Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
        Who never ever learned to read or write so well,<br>
        But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell.<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
        Go Go<br>
        Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
        Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
        Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
        Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
        Johnny B. Goode<br>
        <br>
        He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
        Or sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.<br>
        Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade,<br>
        Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made.<br>
        The people passing by, they would stop and say,<br>
        &quot;Oh, my, but that little country boy could play!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Chorus]</i><br>
        <br>
        His mother told him, &quot;Someday you will be a man,<br>
        And you will be the leader of a big old band.<br>
        Many people coming from miles around<br>
        To hear you play your music when the sun go down.<br>
        Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
        Saying 'Johnny B. Goode tonight'.&quot;<br>

        <br>
        Picket lines and picket signs<br>
        Don't punish me with brutality<br>
        Talk to me, so you can see<br>
        Oh, what's going on<br>
        What's going on<br>
        Ya, what's going on<br>
        Ah, what's going on<br>
        <br>
        In the mean time<br>
        Right on, baby<br>
        Right on<br>
        Right on<br>
        <br>
        Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong<br>
        Oh, but who are they to judge us<br>
        Simply because our hair is long<br>
        Oh, you know we've got to find a way<br>
        To bring some understanding here today<br>
        Oh<br>
        <br>
        Picket lines and picket signs<br>
        Don't punish me with brutality<br>
        Talk to me<br>
        So you can see<br>
        What's going on<br>
        Ya, what's going on<br>
        Tell me what's going on<br>
        I'll tell you what's going on - Uh<br>
        Right on baby<br>
        Right on baby <br><br>

      <h2 id="lyric3">John Lennon, 'Imagine'</h2>
      <div>
        Imagine there's no heaven<br>
        It's easy if you try<br>
        No hell below us<br>
        Above us only sky<br>
        Imagine all the people<br>
        Living for today...<br>
        <br>
        Imagine there's no countries<br>
        It isn't hard to do<br>
        Nothing to kill or die for<br>
        And no religion too<br>
        Imagine all the people<br>
        Living life in peace...<br>
        <br>
        You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
        But I'm not the only one<br>
        I hope someday you'll join us<br>
        And the world will be as one<br>
        <br>
        Imagine no possessions<br>
        I wonder if you can<br>
        No need for greed or hunger<br>
        A brotherhood of man<br>
        Imagine all the people<br>
        Sharing all the world...<br>
        <br>
        You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
        But I'm not the only one<br>
        I hope someday you'll join us<br>
        And the world will live as one <br><br>

      <h2 id="lyric2">The Rolling Stones, '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'</h2>
      <div>
        I can't get no satisfaction<br>
        I can't get no satisfaction<br>
        'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try<br>
        I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
        When I'm drivin' in my car<br>
        And that man comes on the radio<br>
        And he's tellin' me more and more<br>
        About some useless information<br>
        Supposed to fire my imagination<br>
        I can't get no, oh no no no<br>
        Hey hey hey, that's what I say<br>
        I can't get no satisfaction<br>
        I can't get no satisfaction<br>
        'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try<br>
        I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
        When I'm watchin' my TV<br>
        And that man comes on to tell me<br>
        How white my shirts can be<br>
        But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke<br>
        The same cigarrettes as me<br>
        I can't get no, oh no no no<br>
        Hey hey hey, that's what I say<br>
        I can't get no satisfaction<br>
        I can't get no girl reaction<br>
        Cause I try and I try and I try and I try<br>
        I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
        When I'm ridin' round the world<br>
        And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that<br>
        And I'm tryin' to make some girl<br>
        Who tells me baby better come back later next week<br>
        Cause you see I'm on losing streak<br>
        I can't get no, oh no no no<br>
        Hey hey hey, that's what I say<br>
        I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
        I can't get no satisfaction<br>
        No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction <br><br>

      <h2 id="lyric1">Bob Dylan, 'Like a Rolling Stone'</h2>
      <div>
        Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
        You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you ?<br>
        People'd call, say, &quot;Beware doll, you're bound to fall.&quot;<br>
        You thought they were all kiddin' you<br>
        You used to laugh about<br>
        Everybody that was hangin' out<br>
        Now you don't talk so loud<br>
        Now you don't seem so proud<br>
        About having to be scrounging for your next meal.<br>
        <br>
        How does it feel?<br>
        How does it feel<br>
        To be without a home<br>
        Like a complete unknown<br>
        Like a rolling stone ?<br>
        <br>
        You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely<br>
        But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
        And nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street<br>
        And now you're gonna have to get used to it<br>
        You said you'd never compromise<br>
        With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
        He's not selling any alibis<br>
        As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
        And say do you want to make a deal?<br>
        <br>
        How does it feel?<br>
        How does it feel<br>
        To be on your own<br>
        With no direction home<br>
        A complete unknown<br>
        Like a rolling stone ?<br>
        <br>
        You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns<br>
        When they all come down and did tricks for you<br>
        You never understood that it ain't no good<br>
        You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you<br>
        You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br>
        Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br>
        Ain't it hard when you discover that<br>
        He really wasn't where it's at<br>
        After he took from you everything he could steal.<br>
        <br>
        How does it feel?<br>
        How does it feel<br>
        To be on your own<br>
        With no direction home<br>
        Like a complete unknown<br>
        Like a rolling stone ?<br>
        <br>
        Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people<br>
        They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made<br>
        Exchanging all precious gifts<br>
        But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe<br>
        You used to be so amused<br>
        At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>
        Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse<br>
        When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br>
        You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.<br>
        <br>
        How does it feel<br>
        How does it feel<br>
        To be on your own<br>
        With no direction home<br>
        Like a complete unknown<br>
        Like a rolling stone ? <br> <br>
