      <h2>Ray Charles</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>Ray Charles Robinson</strong> (September 23, 1930 â€“ June 10, 2004), professionally known as Ray
          Charles, was an American singer, songwriter, musician and composer. He was sometimes referred to as "The
          Genius", and was also nicknamed "The High Priest of Soul".</p>

        <p>He pioneered the genre of soul music during the 1950s by combining rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues
          styles into the music he recorded for Atlantic Records. He also contributed to the racial integration of
          country and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his
          two Modern Sounds albums. While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American
          musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.
          Charles was blind from the age of seven. Charles cited Nat King Cole as a primary influence, but his
          music was also influenced by jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, and country artists of the day, including
          Art Tatum, Louis Jordan, Charles Brown and Louis Armstrong. Charles' playing reflected influences from
          country blues, barrelhouse and stride piano styles. He had strong ties to Quincy Jones, who often cared
          for him and showed him the ropes of the "music club industry."</p>

        <p>Frank Sinatra called him <q>the only true genius in show business</q>, although Charles downplayed this
          notion.</p>

        <p>In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Charles at number <a href="index.html#song10">ten</a> on their list of the
          "100 Greatest Artists of All Time", and number two on their November 2008 list of the "100 Greatest
          Singers of All Time". Billy Joel observed: <q>This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was
            more important than Elvis Presley.</q></p>

      <h2>Nirvana</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>Nirvana</strong> was an American rock band that was formed by singer and guitarist <em>Kurt
          Cobain</em> and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Nirvana went through a
          succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite
          releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be
          regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era.</p>

        <p>In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first
          album <em>'Bleach'</em> for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to
          develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses.
          After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with <a
              href="index.html#song9">"Smells Like Teen Spirit"</a>, the first single from the band's second
          album <em>Nevermind</em> (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a
          whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the "spokesman of a
          generation", with Nirvana being considered the "flagship band" of Generation X. In response, Nirvana's
          third studio album, <em>In Utero</em> (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged
          the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind, but was still a commercial
          success and critically acclaimed. </p>
        <p>Nirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases
          have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut,
          the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records
          worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and
          Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, in its first year of eligibility.</p>

      <div class="imgBand wow flipInX" id="beatles"><img src="img/beatles.jpg" width="1900" height="700" alt="beatles"/></div>
      <h2>The Beatles</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>The Beatles</strong> were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members <em>John
          Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr</em>, they became widely regarded as the
          foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the
          Beatles later experimented with several genres, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia
          and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their
          enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led
          by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals
          shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.</p>

        <p>The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from
          1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison
          went through a succession of drummers, most notably Pete Best, before settling on Starr. Manager Brian
          Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical
          potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, <em>Love Me Do</em>, in
          late 1962. They acquired the nickname "the Fab Four" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following
          year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the "British Invasion" of the
          United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced what many consider their finest
          material, including the innovative and widely influential albums <em>Rubber Soul</em> (1965),
          <em>Revolver</em>
          (1966), <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> (1967), <em>The Beatles</em> (commonly known as
          the White Album, 1968) and <em>Abbey Road</em> (1969).</p>

        <p>After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths. McCartney
          and Starr, the surviving members, remain musically active. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980,
          and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001.</p>

        <p>According to the RIAA, the Beatles are the best-selling music artists in the United States, with 178
          million certified units. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more <a
              href="index.html#song8">singles</a> in the UK than any other act. In 2008, the group topped
          Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful "Hot 100" artists; as of 2015, they hold the
          record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. They have received ten Grammy Awards,
          an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Collectively included in
          Time magazine's compilation of the twentieth century's 100 most influential people, they are the
          best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide. The group was
          inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, with all four being inducted individually as well
          from 1994 to 2015.</p>

      <h2>Chuck Berry</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry</strong> (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist,
          singer and songwriter, and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as
          <em>"Maybellene"</em>
          (1955), <em>"Roll Over Beethoven"</em> (1956), <em>"Rock and Roll Music"</em> (1957) and <a
              href="index.html#song7">"Johnny B. Goode"</a> (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and
          blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and
          consumerism and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent
          rock music.</p>

        <p>Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music
          from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school
          student he was arrested, and served a prison sentence for armed robbery from 1944 to 1947. After his
          release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953,
          influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of blues player T-Bone Walker, Berry began
          performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955, and
          met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded <em>"Maybellene"</em>â€”Berry's
          adaptation of the country song <em>"Ida Red"</em>â€”which sold over a million copies, reaching number one
          on Billboard's Rhythm and Blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star with
          several hit records and film appearances to his name as well as a lucrative touring career. He had also
          established his own St. Louis-based nightclub, called Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962, Berry
          was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Actâ€”he had transported a 14-year-old
          girl across state lines.</p>

        <p>After his release in 1963, Berry had more hits in the mid 60's, including <em>"No Particular Place to
          Go"</em>, <em>"You Never Can Tell",</em> and <em>"Nadine"</em>. By the mid-1970s, he was more in demand
          as a nostalgic live performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality. In
          1979 he served 120 days in prison for tax evasion.</p>

        <p>Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in
          1986, with the comment that he <q>laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and
            roll stance.</q> Berry is included in several Rolling Stone "Greatest of All Time" lists, including
          being ranked fifth on their 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of
          Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll included three of Berry's songs: <em>"Johnny B. Goode,"</em>
          <em>"Maybellene,"</em> and <em>"Rock and Roll Music."</em> Berry's <em>"Johnny B. Goode"</em> is the
          only rock and roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.</p>

      </div>
      <h2>The Beach Boys</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>The Beach Boys</strong> are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961. The
          group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love,
          and their friend Al Jardine. Emerging at the vanguard of the "California Sound", the band's early music
          gained international popularity for distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics that evoked a southern
          California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Influenced by jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s
          rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band to experiment with several genres ranging from pop
          ballads to psychedelic and baroque, while devising novel approaches to music production and arranging.
          While initially managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated
          songwriting abilities dominated the group's musical direction.</p>

        <p>Released in 1966, the Pet Sounds album and the <a href="index.html#song6">"Good Vibrations"</a> single
          featured an intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of
          the Beach Boys' early years. Soon after the dissolution of Smile, Brian gradually ceded control to the
          rest of the band, reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the
          more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that
          garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in
          America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of
          the band's name transpired.
        </p>
        <p>Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations
          of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members
          pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a
          new studio album and world tour.</p>

        <p>The Beach Boys are regarded as the most iconic American band and one of the most critically acclaimed,
          commercially successful, and widely influential bands of all time, while AllMusic stated that their
          "unerring ability... made them America's first, best rock band." The group had over eighty songs chart
          worldwide, thirty-six of them US Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band), four reaching
          number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records
          worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at number 12 on
          Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". They have received one
          Grammy Award for The Smile Sessions (2011). The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were
          inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.</p>

      <h2>Aretha Franklin</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>Aretha Louise Franklin</strong> (born March 25, 1942) is an American singer and musician.
          Franklin began her career singing gospel at her father, minister C. L. Franklin's church as a child. In
          1960, at the age of 18, Franklin embarked on a secular career, recording for Columbia Records but only
          achieving modest success. Following her signing to Atlantic Records in 1967, Franklin achieved
          commercial acclaim and success with songs such as <a href="index.html#song5">"Respect"</a>, <em>"(You
            Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"</em> and <em>"Think"</em>. These hits and more helped her to
          gain the title The Queen of Soul by the end of the 1960s decade.</p>

        <p>Franklin eventually recorded a total of 112 charted singles on Billboard, including 77 Hot 100 entries,
          17 top ten pop singles, 100 R&amp;B entries and twenty number-one R&amp;B singles, becoming the most
          charted female artist in the chart's history. Franklin also recorded acclaimed albums such as I Never
          Loved a Man the Way I Love You, Lady Soul, Young, Gifted &amp; Black and Amazing Grace before
          experiencing problems with her record company by the mid-1970s. After her father was shot in 1979,
          Franklin left Atlantic and signed with Arista Records, finding success with her part in the film, The
          Blues Brothers and with the albums, Jump to It and Who's Zoomin' Who?. In 1998, Franklin won
          international acclaim for singing the opera aria, <em>"Nessun Dorma"</em>, at the Grammys of that year
          replacing Luciano Pavarotti. Later that same year, she scored her final Top 40 recording with <em>"A
            Rose Is Still a Rose".</em> Franklin's other popular and well known hits include, <em>"Rock Steady",
            "Something He Can Feel"</em> (from the soundtrack to the 1976 film Sparkle), "<em>Jump to It",
            "Freeway of Love", "Who's Zoomin' Who", "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves", "I Knew You Were
            Waiting (For Me)" (with George Michael), "It Isn't, It Wasn't, It Ain't Never Gonna Be"</em> (with
          Whitney Houston) and a remake of The Rolling Stones song <em>'Jumpin' Jack Flash"</em>.</p>

        <p>Franklin has won a total of 18 Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling female artists of all time,
          having sold over 75 million records worldwide. Franklin has been honored throughout her career including
          a 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in which she became the first female performer to
          be inducted. She was inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In August 2012, Franklin was
          inducted into the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Franklin is listed in at least two all-time lists on
          Rolling Stone magazine, including the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, in which she placed number 9,
          and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time in which she placed number 1.</p>

      <h2>Marvin Gaye</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>Marvin Gaye</strong> (born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr.; April 2, 1939 â€“ April 1, 1984) was an American
          soul singer, songwriter, and musician. Gaye helped to shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as
          an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of hits, including <em>How Sweet It
            Is (To Be Loved By You)</em> and <em>I Heard It Through the Grapevine</em>, and duet recordings with
          Mary Wells, Kim Weston, and Tammi Terrell, later earning the titles Prince of Motown and Prince of Soul.
        </p>

        <p>During the 1970s, he recorded the concept albums <a href="index.html#song4">What's Going On</a> and <em>Let's
          Get It On</em> and became one of the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of its
          production company.</p>

        <p>Gaye's later recordings influenced several contemporary R&amp;B subgenres, such as quiet storm and
          neo-soul. Following a period in Europe as a tax exile in the early 1980s, Gaye released the 1982 Grammy
          Award-winning hit "Sexual Healing" and its parent album Midnight Love.</p>

        <p>On April 1, 1984, Gaye's father, Marvin Gay Sr., fatally shot him at their house in the West Adams
          district of Los Angeles. Since his death, many institutions have posthumously bestowed Gaye with awards
          and other honorsâ€”including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of
          Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

      <h2>John Lennon</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>John Winston Ono Lennon MBE</strong> (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 â€“ 8 December 1980)
          was an English singer and songwriter who rose to worldwide fame as a co-founder of the band the Beatles,
          the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul
          McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership.</p>

        <p>Born and raised in Liverpool, as a teenager Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze; his first band,
          the Quarrymen, evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a
          solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and
          iconic songs such as <em>"Give Peace a Chance"</em>, <em>"Working Class Hero"</em>, and <a
              href="index.html#song3">"Imagine"</a>. After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his
          name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant
          son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy. He was murdered three weeks
          after its release.</p>

        <p>Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in
          interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, he moved to Manhattan in 1971, where
          his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon's administration to
          deport him, while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger
          counterculture.</p>

        <p>As of 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States exceeded 14 million and, as writer, co-writer,
          or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. In 2002, a BBC poll
          on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth and, in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest
          singer of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the
          Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994.</p>

      <h2>The Rolling Stones</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>The Rolling Stones</strong> are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The first settled
          line-up consisted of <em>Brian Jones</em> (guitar, harmonica), <em>Ian Stewart</em> (piano), <em>Mick
            Jagger</em> (lead vocals, harmonica), <em>Keith Richards</em> (guitar), <em>Bill Wyman</em> (bass)
          and <em>Charlie Watts</em> (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued
          as occasional pianist until his death in 1985. Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his
          death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1975. Subsequently,
          Ronnie Wood has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl
          Jones has been the main bassist. Other notable keyboardists for the band have included Nicky Hopkins,
          active from 1967 to 1982; Billy Preston through the mid 1970s (most prominent on Black and Blue) and
          Chuck Leavell, active since 1982. The band was first led by Jones but after teaming as the band's
          songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed de facto leadership.</p>

        <p>The Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in
          1964â€“65. At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the
          youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Critic Sean Egan states that within a year of the
          release of their 1964 debut album, they <q>were being perceived by the youth of Britain and then the
            world as representatives of opposition to an old, cruel order â€” the antidote to a class-bound,
            authoritarian culture.</q> They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll and
          of changing the international focus of blues culture to the less sophisticated blues typified by Chess
          Records artists such as Muddy Watersâ€”writer of "Rollin' Stone", after which the band is named. After a
          short period of musical experimentation that culminated with the polarising and largely psychedelic
          album <em>Their Satanic Majesties Request</em> (1967), the group returned to its bluesy roots with <em>Beggars'
            Banquet</em> (1968) whichâ€”along with its follow-ups, <em>Let It Bleed</em> (1969), <em>Sticky
            Fingers</em> (1971) and <em>Exile on Main St.</em> (1972)â€”is generally considered to be the band's
          best work and are considered the Rolling Stones' "Golden Age". It was during this period the band were
          first introduced on stage as "The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band". Musicologist Robert Palmer
          attributed the "remarkable endurance" of the Rolling Stones to being "rooted in traditional verities, in
          rhythm-and-blues and soul music", while "more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone".</p>

        <p>The band continued to release commercially successful records in the 1970s and sold many albums, with
          <em>Some Girls</em> (1978) and <em>Tattoo You</em> (1981) being their two most sold albums worldwide. In
          the 1980s, a feud between Jagger and Richards about the band's musical direction almost caused the band
          to split but they managed to patch their relationship up and had a big comeback with <em>Steel
            Wheels</em> (1989), which was followed by a big stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new
          recorded material from the group has been increasingly less well-received and less frequent. Despite
          this, the Rolling Stones have continued to be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with big stadium
          tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had made what were then four of the top five
          highest-grossing concert tours of all time: <em>Voodoo Lounge Tour</em> (1994â€“95), <em>Bridges to
            Babylon Tour</em> (1997â€“98), <em>Licks Tour</em> (2002â€“03) and <em>A Bigger Bang Tour</em>
          (2005â€“07).</p>

        <p>The Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of
          Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine <a href="index.html#song2">ranked</a> them fourth on the "100
          Greatest Artists of All Time" list, and their estimated sales are above 200 million. They have released
          twenty-nine studio albums, eighteen live albums and numerous compilations. Let It Bleed (1969) was their
          first of five consecutive number one studio and live albums in the UK. Sticky Fingers (1971) was the
          first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the US. In 2013, the band ranked 10th on the
          Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary.</p>

      <h2>Bob Dylan</h2>
      <div class="textContent">
        <p><strong>Bob Dylan</strong> (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer, songwriter,
          artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades.
          Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although
          Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless,
          early songs such as <em>"Blowin' in the Wind"</em> and <em>"The Times They Are a-Changin'"</em> became
          anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. After he left his initial base in the
          American folk music revival, his six-minute single <a href="index.html#song1">"Like a Rolling Stone"</a>
          altered the range of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached
          the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from
          others in the folk movement.</p>

        <p>Dylan's lyrics have incorporated various political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They
          defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired
          by the performances of Little Richard, and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson and Hank
          Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning 50 years,
          has explored the traditions in American songâ€”from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and
          rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American
          Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of
          musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour.
          His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his
          greatest contribution is considered his songwriting.</p>

        <p>Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in
          major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the
          best-selling artists of all time; he has received numerous awards including Grammy, Golden Globe, and
          Academy Award; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame,
          Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008
          awarded him a special citation for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by
          lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power." In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal
          of Freedom from President Barack Obama.</p>
